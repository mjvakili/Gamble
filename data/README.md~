SDSS GALAXY-GALAXY LENSING MEASUREMENTS: ALL GALAXIES}.  The first column is the the mean radii of galaxies in each logarithmic bin, in units of $\kpc.$  Subsequent columns show the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal, $\Delta\Sigma$, in units of $\Msun\mathrm{pc}^{-2}$ for the same three stellar mass, volume-limited threshold samples. Errors in the parenthesis are derived from dividing the survey area into 200 bootstrap subregions and generating 500 bootstrap-resampled datasets.
