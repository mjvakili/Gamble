\title{Can we constrain galaxy assembly bias with group and clustering statistics of SDSS galaxies?}
\author{Mohammadjavad Vakili , others}

\begin{abstract}

The standard halo occupation modeling approach in large scale structure 
studies assumes that the halo mass alone suffices in characterizing the 
galaxy-halo connection. Galaxy assembly bias, the hypothesis that properties beyond 
halo mass influences the galaxy-halo connection, can potentially affect the 
statistical summaries of galaxy populations. The degree to which, assembly bias can 
can be constrained with the statistical distribution of galaxies remains largely 
untested. In this investigation, we make use of the recently proposed assembly bias decoration 
of the HOD modeling in order to find constraints on the strength of the assembly bias from the most up-to-date and publicly available measurements of the group multiplicity function and the projected two-point correlation function of the Volume-limited luminosity threshold sample of SDSS 
galaxies. We find that the available GMF measurements cannot constrain galaxy assembly bias in any of the Luminosity thresholds. On the other hand, we find non-zero constraints on the satellite galaxy assembly bias for the $M_{r}<-18$ and $M_{r}<-19$ samples, nonzero constraints on the central galaxy assembly bias for the $M_{r}<-20$ samples, and constraints consistent with zero for the assembly bias of galaxies in the $M_{r}<-21$ sample. Furthermore, we provide a model comparison between the standard HOD approach and the decorated HOD in modeling of the GMF and the projected 2PCF measurements.

\section{Introduction}
The assumption that galaxies reside dark matter halos 
is the central tenet of the modern cosmology and 
large-scale structure formation theories. 
One of the most powerful methods for describing 
the galaxy-halo connection is the halo occupation modeling. 
The underlying assumption of the traditional HOD framework is 
that the halo mass alone is sufficient in determining the
population of galaxies inside halos. That is, the statistical properties of 
galaxies is governed by the halo mass. Mathematically, this assumption can be 
written as $P(N_g|M_h,\{x\})=P(N_g|M_h)$ where $\{x\}$ is the set of all 
possible halo properties beyond mass $M_{h}$. 

Despite this very simplifying assumption, the galaxy-halo connection models such as HOD and CLF
have been widely and successfully used in modeling the measurements of a wide range of the 
statistical properties of galaxies such as . However, the assumption that the statistical 
distribution of galaxies can be determined by halo mass is not a derived characteristic of 
accurate and high resolution hydrodynamic simulations, but rather a theoretical assumption 
that needs to be scrutinized. In recent years, the idea that the   

In this investigation, we explore the notion that how the dependence of 
galaxy-halo connection on halo properties beyond mass (e.g. concentration, age).
Throughout this paper, unless stated otherwise, 
all radii and densities are in comoving units. Standard flat $\Lambda$CDM is assumed, 
and all cosmological parameters are set to the Planck 2013 best-fit estimates.

\section{Method}
\subsection{Halo occupation modeling}
\subsubsection{standard HOD modeling}\label{subsubsec:hod}
For our standard HOD modeling, HOD parameterization of cite[zheng07] is assumed. According to this parameterization, the occupation of the central galaxies follows a nearest-integer distribution, 
and the occupation of the satellite galaxies follows a Poisson distribution. The expected number of centrals and satellites as a function of the host halo mass of $M_{\rm h}$ are given by the following equations 
\begin{eqnarray}
\langle N_{\rm cen}(M_{\rm h}) \rangle &=& \frac{1}{2}\Big[1+\Big(\frac{\log M_{\rm h} - \log M_{\rm min}}{\sigma_{\log \rm{M}}} \Big) \Big], \label{hod:central}\\ 
\langle N_{\rm sat}(M_{\rm h}) \rangle &=& \Big( \frac{M_{\rm h} - M_{\rm{0}}}{M_{\rm 1}} \Big)^{\alpha}. \label{hod:satellite}
\end{eqnarray}

For populating the halos with galaxies, we follow the procedure described in CITE[HEARIN ETAL], CITE[CHANG ETAL]. The central galaxies are assumed to be at the center of the host dark matter halos. We place the satellite galaxies are within the virial radius of the halo following an NFW profile [CITE NFW]. The concentration of the NFW profile is given by the empirical mass-concentration relation provided by [CITE MACCIO]. The velocities of the satellite galaxies are given by two components. The first component is the velocity of the host halo. The second component is the velocity of the satellite galaxy with respect to the host halo which is computed following the solution to the NFW profile Jeans equations [CITE MORE]. We refer the readers to [CITE HEARIN 15] and \url{http://halotools.readthedocs.io} for a more comprehensive and detailed discussion of the forward modeling of the galaxy mock catalogs.

\subsubsection{Assembly bias HOD modeling}\label{subsubsec:decorated}
Now let us provide a brief overview of HOD modeling decorated with $\mathtt{Heaviside}$ $\mathtt{Assemblybias}$ introduced in [CITE HEARIN2015]. At a fixed halo mass $M_{\rm h}$, halos are split into two populations: population of halos with the 0.5-percentile of highest concentration, and population of halos with 0.5 percentile of lowest concentration.We call the first population "type 1" halos, and the second population "type 2 halos. Following In the decorated HOD model, the expected number of central and satellite galaxies in the two populations is given by

\begin{eqnarray}
\langle N_{c,i} | M_{h},c\rangle &=& \langle N_{c} | M_{h}\rangle + \delta N _{c,i}, \; i=1,2 \label{eq:decoratedcentral} \\
\langle N_{s,i} | M_{h},c\rangle &=& \langle N_{s} | M_{h}\rangle + \delta N _{s,i}, \; i=1,2 \label{eq:decoratedsatellite}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\langle N_{c} | M_{h}\rangle$ and $\langle N_{s} | M_{h}\rangle$ are given by Eqs \ref{hod:central} and \ref{hod:satellite} respectively, and we have $\delta N_{s,0} + \delta N_{s,1} = 0$, and $\delta N_{c,0} + \delta N_{c,1} = 0$. These two conditions ensure the conservation of HOD. At a given host hale mass $M_{h}$, the central occupation of the the two populations follows a Nearest-integer distribution with the first moment given by \ref{eq:decoratedcentral}; and the central occupation of the the two populations follows a Poisson distribution with the first moment given by \ref{eq:decoratedsatellite}. 

In this decorated occupation model, the allowable range for the quantities $\delta N_{c,1}$ and $\delta N_{s,1}$ is given by 
\begin{eqnarray}
-\langle N_{c} | M_{h}\rangle \leq \delta N_{c} \leq \langle N_{c} | M_{h}\rangle
 , \label{eq:cen-bounds} \\
-\langle N_{s} | M_{h}\rangle \leq \delta N_{s} \leq \langle N_{s} | M_{h}\rangle. \label{eq:sat-bounds}
\end{eqnarray}
Afterwards, CITE[HEARIN2015] defines the assembly bias parameter $\mathcal{A}$ in the following way:
\begin{eqnarray}
\delta N_{\alpha , 1}(M_{h}) &=& \mathcal{A_\alpha} \delta N_{\alpha , 1}^{\rm max}(M_{h}) \; \; \rm{if} \; \mathcal{A_\alpha} > 0,  \\
\delta N_{\alpha , 1}(M_{h}) &=& \mathcal{A_\alpha} \delta N_{\alpha , 1}^{\rm min}(M_{h}) \; \; \rm{if} \; \mathcal{A_\alpha} < 0,
\end{eqnarray}
where the subscript $\alpha = c , s$ for the centrals and satellites respectively, and $\delta N_{\alpha , 1}^{\rm max}(M_{h})$, $\delta N_{\alpha , 1}^{\rm min}(M_{h})$ are given by Eqs. \ref{eq:cen-bounds} and \ref{eq:sat-bounds}. 

At a given halo mass $M_{h}$, once the first moments of occupation statistics for the $type$-1 and $type$-2 halos are determined, the same procedure described in \ref{subsubsec:hod} is done to populate the halos with mock galaxies.

\subsubsection{Redshift-space distortion}

Once the halo catalogs are populated with galaxies, the real-space positions and velocities of all mock galaxies are obtained. The next step is applying a redshift-space distortion transformation. Assuming the $\hat{z}$ axis for the direction of the RSD, the transformation $(x,y,z) \rightarrow (s_x,s_y,s_z) = (x , y ,z + v_z/cH_{0})$ is done to obtain the redshift-space coordinate of the produced mock galaxies.   

\subsection{Model Observables}
\subsubsection{group multiplicity function}
Group multiplicity function $g(N)$ is defined as the abundance of the galaxy groups as a 
function of group richness (the number of galaxies in groups) per richness width, measured in bins of richness. 
Galaxy groups in are found by Friends-of-Friends (hereafter FoF) group finder algorithm [CITE FOF]. 
The FoF group finder algorithm links to galaxy $i$ and galaxy $j$ to each other, if the projected distance between the two galaxies $D_{\perp , i,j}$ is less than a specified projected linking length $b{_\perp}$, and the line-of-sight distance between the two galaxies $D_{\parallel, i,j}$ is less than a specified line-of-sight linking length $b{_\parallel}$. These linking lengths are measured in units of the mean inter-particle distance ($n_{\rm g}^{-1/3}$). In order to be consistent with the [CITE BERLIND] measurements, the linking lengths $b_{\perp}$ and $b_{\parallel}$ are set to to 0.15 and 0.74 respectively. 

After populating the dark matter halo catalogs with galaxies, we use the $\mathtt{Halotools}$ implementation of the FoF group-finder algorithm to identify the FoF groups with the mentioned linking lengths. Afterwards, we compute the number density of the galaxy groups in bins of richness to measure the group multiplicity function. Note that $g(N)$ is measured in units of $h^{3}\rm{Mpc}^{-3}$.
\subsubsection{projected two-point correlation function}
The projected two point correlation function $w_{\rm{p}}(r_{\rm{p}})$ can be computed by integrating the 3D redshift space 2PCF $\xi(r_{\rm{p}} , \pi)$ along the line-of-sight
\beq
w_{\rm{p}}(r_{\rm{p}}) = 2 \int_{0}^{\infty} d\pi \;\xi(r_{\rm{p}} , \pi)
\eeq
For our 2PCF calculations, we use the $w_{\rm p}$ measurement functionality of the fast and publicly available pair-counter code $\mathtt{CorrFunc}$ [CITE CORRFUNC].  To be consistent with the SDSS measurements described in \ref{sec:data}, $w_{\rm{p}}(r_{\rm{p}})$ is obtained by the line-of-sight integration to $\pi_{max}=40 \; h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$. Note that $w_{\rm{p}}(r_{\rm{p}})$ is measured in units of $h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$.

\subsection{Simulation}

For the simulations used in this work, we make use of the Rockstar (cite[Behroozi]) halo catalogs in the $z=0$ Bolshoi-Planck high 
resolution $N$-body simulation CITE[Klypin2014]. This simulation was carried out using the adaptive refinement tree code 
(ART, see cite[Kravstov]) code, following the Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters 
$\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.307$, $\Omega_{\rm b} = 0.048$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 0.693$, $\sigma_{8} = 0.823$, $n_{\rm s}=0.96$, 
$h=0.678$. The Box size for this $N$-body simulation is 250 $h^{-1} \rm{Mpc}$, the number of simulation particles is 2048$^3$, 
the mass per simulation particle $m_{\rm p}$ is $1.5 \times 10^{8} \; h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, and the gravitational softening length 
$\epsilon$ is 1 $h^{-1} \rm{kpc}$. 

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}

We focus on two sets of measurements made on the volume limited luminosity threshold main sample of galaxies in the SDSS spectroscopic survey. In this section, we briefly describe the measurements used in our study for finding constraints on the assembly bias parameters.

\subsection{group multiplicity function}

The first set of measurements consists of the galaxy number densities $n_{g}$ and the group multiplicity functions $g(N)$ described in [CITE BERLIND 2006]. These measurements are made 
for the three Volume limited samples of the SDSS galaxies with luminosity thresholds of $M_{r}<-18$, $M_{r}<-19$, and $M_{r}<-20$. Galaxy groups in [CITE BERLIND etal] are found by Friends-of-Friends (hereafter FoF) group finder algorithm [CITE FOF]. [CITE BERLIND ETAL] sets $b_{\perp}$ to 0.15 and $b_{\parallel}$ to 0.74 to minimize the discrepancy between the multiplicity function, projected size, and the number of FoF groups and those of the halos in a suite of simulations.

The measurements are accompanied by two sets of uncertainty measurements. The first one is the error on $g(N)$ that stems from the dispersion between $g(N)$ measurements of different mock catalogs. The second source of error is the Poisson error that results from the number of groups in each richness bin. Finally, these two uncertainties are added in quadrature 
to estimate the total error on [CITE BERLIND ETAL] $g(N)$ measurements.

\subsection{projected 2PCF}

The second set consists of the number density $n_{g}$ and the projected 2PCF $w_{\rm{p}}(r_{\rm{p}})$. The project 2PCFs are measured in 12 logarithmic $r_{\rm p}$ bins (in units of $h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$) of width $\Delta \log(r_{\rm p}) = 0.2$, starting from $r_{\rm{p}} = 0.1 \; h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$. These measurements are accompanied by their corresponding covariance matrices constructed using 400 jackknife sub-samples of the data. The advantage of using these measurements is that the effects of fiber collision systematics on the two-point statistics are corrected for, and therefore, they provide very accurate small scale clustering measurements [see CITE GUO 2015]. As [CITE HEARIN2015] demonstrates the satellite assembly bias $\mathcal{A}_{\rm sat}$ can have 10 $\%$ level impact on the small scale galaxy clustering.  

\section{Analysis and Results}

\subsection{Inference setup}

We aim to constrain the parameters of the HOD model described in \ref{subsubsec:hod}, and the parameters of the assembly bias HOD model described in \ref{subsubsec:decorated}, given two sets of SDSS measurements described in \ref{sec:data}. For the tests with group multiplicity function as observable, we use measurements with maximum absolute luminosity $M_{\rm r , max}$ of -18, -19, and -20. Finally, for the tests with the projected 2PCF, we use measurements with $M_{\rm r , max}$ of -18, -19, -20, and -21.  

We sample from the posterior probability distribution $p(\theta|d) \propto p(d|\theta) \pi(\theta)$. In the standard HOD modeling 
\beq
\theta = \{ \mmin, \; \sigmam, \; \mzero, \; \alpha, \; \mone \},
\eeq
and in the Heaviside assembly bias modeling we have 
\beq
\theta = \{ \mmin, \; \sigmam, \; \mzero, \; \alpha, \; \mone, \; \acen, \; \asat \},
\eeq
Furthermore, data (denoted by $d$) is the combination $[n_{g},g(N)]$ when GMF is used, and $[n_{g}, w_{\rm{p}}(r_{\rm{p}})]$ when 2PCF is used.

Now we need to specify the likelihood function $p(d|\theta)$. In the case where the observables are the number density and the GMF are used the negative log-likelihood is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
-2\ln p(d|\theta) &=& \frac{[n^{\rm data}_{g}-n^{\rm model}_{g}]^{2}}{\sigma_{n}^{2}} \nonumber \\ &+& \sum_{N} \frac{[ g^{\rm data}(N)-g^{\rm model}(N)]^{2}}{\sigma^{2}_{N}} \; + \; \rm{const.},
\label{eq:lnlike_group}
\end{eqnarray}
where the summation is over the group richness bins, and $\sigma_{N}$ is the uncertainty associated with the richness bin $N$. In the case, where the number density and 2PCF are used, the negative log-likelihood is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
-2\ln p(d|\theta) &=& \frac{[n^{\rm data}_{g}-n^{\rm model}_{g}]^{2}}{\sigma_{n}^{2}} \nonumber \\  
&+&  \sum_{\rm p} \Delta \wpp^{\rm T}C^{-1}\Delta \wpp \; + \; \rm{const.},
\label{eq:lnlike_wp}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Delta \wpp(\rpp) = \wpp^{\rm data}(\rpp)-\wpp^{\rm model}(\rpp)$, and  $C^{-1}$ is inverse of the estimate of the jackknife covariance matrix provided by [CITE GUO2015]. 
Another important ingredient of our analysis is specification of the prior probabilities over the parameters of the two halo occupation models. For both model, we use uniform flat priors for all the parameters. The prior ranges are specified in the Table \ref{tab:prior}.

For sampling from the posterior probability, given the likelihood function (see Eqs. \ref{eq:lnlike_group}, \ref{eq:lnlike_wp}) and the prior probability distributions (see Table \ref{tab:prior}), we use the affine-invariant ensemble MCMC sampler $\mathtt{emcee}$ (CITE[FORMAN-MACKEY]). In particular, we run the $\mathtt{emcee}$ code with 140 walkers and we run the chains for at least 15000 iterations until the convergence of the MCMC chains is ensured. For testing the convergence of the chains, we perform Gelman-Rubin convergence test [CITE GELMANANDRUBIN and the other paper].

\subsection{model comparison}

Now that we have presented constraints on the parameters of the Heaviside assembly bias HOD model and those found from the standard HOD model using the group and clustering measurements of the SDSS galaxies, it is necessary to make comparison between the the two models in terms of the goodness of fit. Evidently, the Heaviside Assembly bias model has more complexity for modeling the halo occupation. The question that arises is whether this higher level of model complexity is more preferable by the group statistics and the clustering data used in this study. 

There are various methods for model comparison. In this work we make use of two model comparison criteria: \emph{Akaike Information Criterion} (AIC, see CITE ... ), and \emph{Bayesian Information Criteria} (BIC, see CITE ....). AIC and BIC are two widely used methods for assessing the relative quality of models given a set of observations.
Suppose that $\mathcal{L}_{\rm max}$ is the maximum likelihood of the data given a model, $N_{\rm par}$ is the number of parameters of a given model, and $N_{\rm data}$ is the number of data points. Then we have

\begin{eqnarray}
AIC&=& -2\;\ln \mathcal{L}_{\rm max} + 2N_{\rm par} + 2\;\frac{N_{\rm par}(N_{\rm par}+1)}{N_{\rm data}-N_{\rm par}-1} \; , \label{eq:aic}\\
BIC&=& -2\;\ln \mathcal{L}_{\rm max} + N_{\rm par}\;\ln N_{\rm data} \; . \label{eq:bic}
\end{eqnarray}
Models that deliver lower values of information criteria are more favorable. In Eqs. (\ref{eq:aic}) and (\ref{eq:bic}) $N_{\rm par}$ is 5 when the standard HOD model is used, and 7 when the Heaviside assembly bias model is used. When the observables are $\ngal$ and $\wpp$, $N_{\rm data}$ is 13 for all luminosity thresholds, and when the observables are $\ngal$ and $\gmf$, $N_{\rm data}$ is 16 for the $\mr < -18$ luminosity threshold, 23 for the $\mr < -19$ luminosity threshold, and 25 for the $\mr < -20$ luminosity threshold.
